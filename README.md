# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
A set of activities to give an overview of the concepts of modelling &amp; Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Software Engineering.

## Activities
* Create a new Github repository called introduction-to-oop-project in your personal Github account
* Use the Java language track for your specific programme.
  * [Activity One](Exercises/activity_1.md)
  * [Activity Two](Exercises/activity_2.md)
  * [Activity Three](Exercises/activity_3.md)
  * [Activity Four](Exercises/activity_4.md)
  * [Activity Five](Exercises/activity_5.md)
* Work through the activities in order for that language track and commit your work to your introduction-to-oop-project Github repository
  * Exercise One:
    * No output, just a reading exercise
  * Exercise Two: 
    * [Diagram for Exercise 2.3](./Solutions/Exercise%202.3.jpg)
    * [Bird class for Exercise 2.4-5](./src/main/java/com/tinkabell/exercises/Bird.java)
    * [Output from Exercise 2.5](./Solutions/Exercise%202.5%20Output.txt)
  * Exercise Three:
    * [Diagram for Exercise 3.2](./Solutions/Exercise%203.2.jpg)
    * [Pigeon class for Exercise 3.3-4](./src/main/java/com/tinkabell/exercises/Pigeon.java)
    * [Output from Exercise 3.4](./Solutions/Exercise%203.4%20Output.txt)
    * [Output from Exercise 3 Optional](./Solutions/Exercise%203%20Optional%20Output.txt)
  * Exercise Three:
    * [Diagram for Exercise 4.3](./Solutions/Exercise%204.3.jpg)
    * Pigeon and Bird classes changed (links above)
    * [Output from Exercise 4.5](./Solutions/Exercise%204.5%20Output.txt)
    * [Diagram for Exercise 4.6](./Solutions/Exercise%204.6.jpg)
    * [Penguin class for Exercise 4.7-8](./src/main/java/com/tinkabell/exercises/Penguin.java)
    * [Output from Exercise 4.8](./Solutions/Exercise%204.8%20Output.txt)
    * [Parrot class for Exercise 4.9](./src/main/java/com/tinkabell/exercises/Parrot.java)
    * [Output from Exercise 4.9](./Solutions/Exercise%204.9%20Output.txt)

## Notes
* Each activity contains Key Study Notes highlighting key concepts for your learning
* The [ProvidedSolution](./ProvidedSolution) folder contains the solutions to the UML diagramming exercises. 
  * We recommend you try the exercises first before looking at the final solution for the best learning experience.
